- [PROD] Deploy basic domain validation as opt-in feature
- [PROD] Monitor and validate basic security implementation

## 10. Documentation and Testing (PARTIALLY NEEDED)

### Testing

- [OPTIONAL] Unit tests for JWT validation logic
- [OPTIONAL] Integration tests for security endpoints
- [OPTIONAL] End-to-end tests for widget security flows
- [FUTURE] Security penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
- [FUTURE] Performance testing with security features enabled

## 11. Monitoring and Maintenance (FUTURE/PRODUCTION)

### Security Monitoring

- [x] Implement security event logging and alerting (security-audit.ts created)
- [FUTURE] Create dashboards for security metrics and incidents
